              TON 618 is, strictly speaking, a quasar, but the name also refers to
              the supermassive black hole (more properly TON 618*) that powers it,
              which is one of the largest ever discovered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Taking its name from the Tonantzintla Observatory in Mexico, it was
              first observed and catalogued by astronomers Braulio Iriarte and Enrique
              Chavira in 1957.
            </p>
            <p>
              TON 618 lies some 18.2 billion lightyears from Earth, in the constellation
              Canes Venatici.
            </p>
            <p>
              When first observed, TON 618 was thought to be a blue star. Then in 1970
              a radio survey conducted in Italy detected radio emissions coming from the
              object, identifying it as a quasar.
            </p>
            <p>
              A quasar is a type of active galactic nucleus (AGN). An AGN is a region in
              the centre of a galaxy that emits significant amounts of electromagnetic
              radiation, which comes from the material falling into the supermassive black
              hole that lies at the galaxy’s very heart.
            </p>
            <p>
              With about 40 billion times the mass of the Sun and a diameter about 30-40
              times that of our Solar System, TON 618 is a strong contender for the title
              of ‘largest black hole ever discovered’.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though it’s worth noting that there are various ways you can compare black
              holes. So while TON 618 would be many astronomers’ pick for the top spot,
              there are a couple of others, Phoenix A* and the snappily-named SDSS
              J140821.67+025733.2, that also have their supporters.

              The Andromeda Galaxy (M31, NGC 224) is the nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way, located about 2.48 million light-years from Earth. It is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of approximately 200,000 light-years. The Andromeda Galaxy is one of the few galaxies visible to the naked eye, appearing as a milky blur in the night sky.

              The Andromeda Galaxy has a complex history of interactions with other galaxies. It has merged with smaller galaxies, resulting in features like the star streams and clouds found in its outer regions. Its companion galaxy, M32, shows signs of having been a more massive galaxy before losing much of its outer structure due to interactions with Andromeda.
            </p>
            <p>
              Andromeda is expected to collide with the Milky Way in about 4.5 billion years, forming a new, larger galaxy. This collision will significantly alter the structure of both galaxies, though individual stars are unlikely to collide due to the vast distances between them.

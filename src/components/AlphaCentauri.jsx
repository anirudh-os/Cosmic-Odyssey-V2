              Alpha Centauri is a star system consisting of three stars: Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, and Proxima Centauri. Located 4.2 to 4.4 light-years from Earth, it is the closest star system to our Sun. Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf, is the closest star to Earth after the Sun, at just over 4.24 light-years away. Alpha Centauri A and B are both similar to the Sun but are farther from Earth.

              Alpha Centauri A and B form a binary system, orbiting each other in a wide elliptical orbit. Proxima Centauri, much farther from the binary pair, orbits them at a distance of 0.2 light-years. Due to its proximity and brightness, Alpha Centauri has been a key focus for astronomical studies, particularly for the search for exoplanets in the habitable zone. In 2016, an Earth-sized exoplanet, Proxima b, was discovered orbiting Proxima Centauri, sparking interest in the possibility of life beyond our solar system.
